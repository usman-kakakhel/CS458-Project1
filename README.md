- NodeJS has to be downloaded and installed - https://nodejs.org/en/ (Windows version).
- Run “npm install” for installing node modules.
- First of all, in order to activate the database, open a new terminal and run the command “npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000”. The terminal should     be open throughout the application runtime.
- Finally, open a new terminal and run the command “npm start”. This command will open a new window with the link “localhost:3000”, which is actually the landing     page of the application.
- For running the test cases after the application has been run, install Pytest.
- Then goto the tests folder and run “pytest test_case_x.py -s -c” where x is from 1 to 5 for each test case type described below.
